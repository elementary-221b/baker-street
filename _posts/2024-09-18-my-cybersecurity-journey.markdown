I’m thrilled to share my journey into the fascinating world of cybersecurity with you. My path began 15 years ago, not in a traditional IT role, but as an Air Force logistician. It was during this time that I was introduced to the critical need for establishing remote networking, RFID tracking, and basic computer troubleshooting. These tasks were directed to me and a small, dedicated team, and it was here that my passion for technology and cybersecurity was ignited. The turning point was when I earned my CompTIA A+ certification, this achievement was more than just a credential; it was a revelation. It made me realize that my true passion lay in the realm of cybersecurity. From that moment on, I was determined to delve deeper into this field and make a meaningful impact. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with various technologies and tools, including Opnsense, Linux, SQL, python and Docker. My experience has also extended to hardware, such as routers, SBC's like the RaspberryPi and building out networking infrastructure. Each step of the way has been a learning experience, and I’m excited to continue growing and sharing my knowledge with you. This blog is a space where I will document my ongoing journey, share insights from my experiences, and provide valuable resources for anyone interested in cybersecurity. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting out, I hope you’ll find something here that inspires and informs you. Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Let’s explore the world of cybersecurity together!

## Everyone needs a Raspberry Pi
Making learning fun is the best way to get, and stay, invested. Both Raspian and DietPi are easy to use distributions to get started from any level of IT and cybersecurity background. With Raspberry Pi OS, there is a wealth of community support, a friendly to use debian desktop environment and a plethora of first and third-party accessories to keep you interested for years. I personally have favored DietPi, this is a "bare-bones" platform with some nice tricks up its sleeve. A suite of software that is pre-configured is just a few clicks away. Make a game system with RetroPie, build a NAS with OMV, host your own streaming service with Emby or Plex. 
Why do I bring this up? This is how learning becomes fun. I followed tutorials and learned about the Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). When services have errors, I learned about logging, the command-line interface (CLI) and Linux Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
What is Debian and why is Linux important to this journey? Linux has been the backbone of the enterprise and server environment.

This will be on the test...wait, there's a test? Yes, many, but not here. The road to a cybersecurity career can go many ways, but cybersecurity and other IT sectors, are unique in that beyond the traditional experience and education requirements, there is the additional aspects of Validation, Credibility and Trust. The cybersecurity path can be complimented with industry recognized certifications from CompTIA, Cisco, ISACA and others. During the learning, from both the college and certificate agency, it helps to take this coursework and apply it in a live (or virtual live) environment. Test stateful and stateless firewalls with your RaspberryPi, change file permissions and ownership, create a docker and test configurations in a disposable environment. 
My $50 investment has helped me immensely in my journey. Beside just a learning platform, it currently acts as my DNS server, network attached storage (NAS), media server, and my PC restore points (shadow copies).

Working backwards to move forwards. 
Find your dream jobs on platforms like LinkedIn, USAJOBS, and Glassdoor. Break down each element for the job post; what are common qualification requirements for each of the selected jobs? What level of experience is required, what are the desirable skills listed? Is there any terminology used that you don't know? Do you fully understand the key responsibilities required for the position?
This is your roadmap. 
With my background, I need to lean more heavily on my 'transferable skills' to balance the technical skills I need to develop. I have gone to multiple resume building workshops and taken concepts and formats from each to create a product that highlights my unique skillsets. I can only tell you the process from my point of view and I hope that does not deter anyone, if they are at a different part of their journey, or on a different journey all together. I used the resources that I know, took advantage of the benefits that have been afforded to me, and built from there. The military offers a 'Transition Assistance Program' to help translate the mess of jargon accumulated over the decades and try to use it as a semi-coherent form of communication. In short, the resume I created there sucked. I took the template I developed to several other job fairs and resume workshops and asked for any and every bit of feedback they would offer. Throughout my Air Force career, I have saved my annual performance reports, awards, and nominations. This would be my source documents for accomplishments, projects, and job performance that I could mold to match the scope of the job listing. Use what you have available as your source documents, whether it's school projects, volunteer/community involvement, or skills you developed. Find the things that show your uniqueness, and follow your roadmap to your dream job.

* Get a Raspberry Pi
* Pursue industry certifications
* Use job announcements as a guide
* Build your skills

What's next? Currently, I'm learning to build my own blog (thank you Github for free hosting). I'm completing a Google Cybersecurity certificate program (thank you Onward to Opportunity for the free course) and studying for my CompTIA Security+. I enjoy all the content from @NetworkChuck, the way he delivers the content makes understanding the material easy. I feel more confident tackling these goals with tools like Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI to explain in different terms when I get stuck and provide examples to clarify code. I plan to continually add tools and resources in the following posts to help the community and share my discoveries along the way. "The game is afoot!"
